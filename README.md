# Gauntlet Chest Popup

**NOTE: Currently, this plugin also requires the `Loot Tracker` plugin to be enabled!**

- Displays a barrows-chest style UI when you loot the Gauntlet chest!
- Plays a sounds when you get a rare item

## Customization

- Chest sprite color
  - original (light blue), corrupted (red), blue, green, yellow, white, purple
- Chest title
- Which items the rare item sound is played for
  - Weapon seed, Armour seed and/or Enhanced seed

If you'd like to preview your customization you can run the command (type in chat) `::gauntletlootpreview`.
This will bring up the popup with some fake loot.

### Other Notes

- Can be closed with the close icon, by pressing ESC or by clicking outside the popup (if that setting is enabled).
- From my testing this *Should* be included in screenshots taken by the `Screenshots` plugin.
