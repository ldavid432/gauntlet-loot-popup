### Other Notes

- Can be closed with the close icon, by pressing ESC or by clicking outside the popup (if that setting is enabled).
- From my testing this *Should* be included in screenshots taken by the `Screenshots` plugin.
- The popup position is moveable
  - Hold Alt (or whatever your Drag Hotkey is set to) and left-click drag to move
  - Hold Alt and right-click the popup to reset the position to default
